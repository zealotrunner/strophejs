NEW: IE support (all tests pass in IE 6, 7, 8)

This fork of Strophe contains a framework that makes it easy to parse
and handle incoming XML stanzas.  Several plugins have been built using
this framework. They reside in plugins/, along with corresponding tests
in tests/:

mixin.support.js - the mixin framework that makes the other plugins possible (this is a required include for the other plugins)
plugin.0004.js - dataforms 
plugin.0030.js - disco#items support
plugin.0045.js - MUC support for basics and then some
plugin.0050.js - some support for sending and receiving adhoc stanzas
plugin.0060.js - comprehensive PubSub support
plugin.roster.js - roster and presence subscription management
plugin.cm.js - Connection manager: used to actively detect disconnections and reconnect.  Also guarantees that stanzas sent while disconnected are not lost and resent when connection is re-established.  Currently, breaks Strophe when this plugin is loaded but not enabled.

No modifications to the core Strophe library are made and it is periodically synced with metajack's upstream.

See the corresponding tests (and plugin source) for sample usage.  Examples to come.

The plugins' APIs will be kept as stable as possible, but are subject 
to change as some plugins are still under active development 
(release early, release often!).
